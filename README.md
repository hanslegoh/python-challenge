## UCSD Data Science Bootcamp Module 3 Challenge

### Code Sources and Locations:

Lines 1, 2, 17, and 20 to 22 - From `read_csv_solution.py`

Lines 22, 51, 62, and 65 to 70 - From `geeksforgeeks.org website`

Lines 73 and 76 to 80 - From `census_solution.py`

### **Note:**

In case of when the code cannot find the csv file, refer to `line 17`, as I have added my `Starter Code` folder into my parent `Module 3 Challenge - Python` folder that includes my local repo `python challenge`.
